# Feature work 25 Sep 2022

Problem 1: using "removeAllTags" does not remove all tags, only some. These are confirmed to be tags that were applied by the tool.

Problem 2: repo names appear to be abbreviated in some cases e.g. to 13 characters instead of 30. As far as we can tell the abbreviated tags are the ones not removed

Problem 3: Some projects don't have tags applied

## Test cases

1. Ensure tag creation and import works with a bitbucket repo name with up to 50 characters

2. Test with two repos that have a name with the first 49 characters in common and then a difference at the 50th character

3. Test with a single application that has at least one of each of: manifest, code project, dockerfile, kubernetes .yaml, terraform file and dockerhub import, kubernetes monitor

4. Above works to add and remove all tags

5. Logging and error handling to make sure there is no time out on API calls if a tag already exists

## Tests:

1. Reset all tags
2. Create BB repo & import to Snyk
3. Update bitbucket-cloud-import-targest.json
4. Run buildProjectsByOrg.js
5. Apply tags
6. Review tags applied
7. Review tags removed 

Test Set 1:
Name: to-app(8)
Results: Not all projects are tagged. Next step. See "Issue 1 - Not all projects are tagged.pdf"
Use test data set:
bitbucket-cloud-import-targets-Test-1.json
Work: refactored code to avoid API time outs
Outcome: tests passed
Note that filters in project view only include projects with issues

Test Set 2:
Name: to-strawberry(13)
Results: tests passed

Test Set 3:
Name: to-strawberry-emery-versed-pandowdy-rummage-the-to (50)
Results: tests passed
